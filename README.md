3. Task 3: All you need you to do is add two emoji labels to the view. the Figure below shows the expected result. 

Hint, the "smiling face" emoji label should be 33 points away from the top anchor of the safe area, and centered horizontally.
The "ghost" label has two spacing constraints.
You can adjust the font size of the label by editing its Font option in the Attributes inspector
